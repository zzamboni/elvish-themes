* Elvish themes

This package contains Elvish themes I have developed. Install it using [[https://elvish.io/ref/epm.html][epm]]:

#+begin_src elvish
  use epm
  epm:install github.com/zzamboni/elvish-themes
#+end_src

*Please note:* These modules are only guaranteed to be fully compatible with [[https://elv.sh/get/][Elvish HEAD]], which is what I use. This means that occasionally, they will not work even with the latest official release, when breaking changes are introduced. Since Elvish is in active development, I highly recommend you use the latest commit too.

Currently the following themes are included:

** chain

Chain prompt theme, based on the fish theme at [[https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-chain][https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-chain]].

See the install and use instructions in [[file:chain.org][chain.org]].
